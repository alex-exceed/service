You will need to have specific [roles in the multidisciplinary team](../roles/) before you start Discovery stage. The same roles will be in the team through Alpha and Beta stages to release of the service in Live stage. There might be other roles in the team at different stages to support them.

You might need to recruit people for the team or there may be people you are already working with.

The team may include people who are ongoing or non-ongoing staff in the Australian Public Service and contractors.

You need to find people who will form a [digitally capable team](../digital-capability-team/). This means the people in the team will be able to start collaborating quickly to build momentum. They should have experience working in a multidisciplinary team or have the capability to work in this way.

If your team is missing skills or team members need to build their skills, consider bringing in an expert and allowing a team member to shadow them.
