People in a multidisciplinary team need the right mindset as well as skills.

Team members should be open to new ways of thinking and doing things. They should:
- be keen to regularly share their knowledge
- have a flexible outlook — so they can adapt their work in response to user research
- value the contributions of all team members equally — regardless of their seniority in the organisation
- be willing to fail fast and learn quickly
- have an open mind and a willingness to learn
