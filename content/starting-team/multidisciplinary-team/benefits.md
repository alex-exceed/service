When you build services as a multidisciplinary team, the end users and other key stakeholders have a voice from the start. All of the people who have an interest in the service are together from the beginning to collaborate. 

The benefits of multidisciplinary teams are that:
- roles that were traditionally inserted at the end of a project (and often too late to do their best work) can have input from the beginning
- complementary skills are working together at the same time on the same part of the service
- the team is always jointly responsible for delivery

The team uses in-depth user research when they start to make decisions about what to build and how to deliver it. This means services are:
- built using user-centred design — developed iteratively and closely with users
- guided by data and testing — they reflects the actual user journey 
- focused on the end-to-end experience — they are simpler, clearer and faster

### [2]Multidisciplinary teams make it easier to deliver

Traditionally government has formed teams around agency structures and they typically work in a linear way. Multiple teams ‘own’ different parts of the product. Specialists don’t get the chance to work together to come up with creatives solutions.

Multidisciplinary teams change this by forming teams around a problem or a service. The team is formed with all the right skills to deliver incremental bits of value that meet a user need. The team is formed with the correct capability and skills to be autonomous and minimise dependencies. The teams are small (less than 10) and are co-located and are empowered to make decisions and to iterate rapidly.
