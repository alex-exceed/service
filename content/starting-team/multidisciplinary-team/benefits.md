When you build services as a multidisciplinary team, the end users and other key stakeholders have a voice from the start. All of the people who have an interest in the service are together from the beginning to collaborate. 

The benefits of multidisciplinary teams are that:
- roles that were traditionally inserted at the end of a project (and often too late to do their best work) can have input from the beginning
- complementary skills are working together at the same time on the same part of the service
- the team is always jointly responsible for delivery

The team uses in-depth user research when they start to make decisions about what to build and how to deliver it. This means services are:
- built using user-centred design — developed iteratively and closely with users
- guided by data and testing — they reflects the actual user journey 
- focused on the end-to-end experience — they are simpler, clearer and faster

### [2]Multidisciplinary teams make it easier to deliver

Traditionally government has built digital products and services using different teams of people with specialist skills working on their own (for example, a visual design team and a web development team in different parts of an organisation).

Projects build this way are usually led by a project manager using waterfall development approaches. In this way of working:
design and development are linear and outsourced processes
multiple teams ‘own’ different parts of the product
specialists don’t get the chance to work together to come up with creatives solutions

Multidisciplinary teams change this by starting with all the roles you need in the same team. The decision makers are also part of the team so it’s quicker to remove blockers and to find creative solutions. The most creative and innovative solutions are reached when team members extend themselves into other skillsets. There are unexpected connections that occur in multidisciplinary teams.
