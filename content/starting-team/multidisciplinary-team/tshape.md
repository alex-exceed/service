### [2]Find people with T-shaped skills

Look for team members with ‘T-shaped’ skills. These are people who have deep knowledge in a discipline and the ability to collaborate with people in other roles.

People with T-shaped skills are natural collaborators. They apply their deep knowledge to other capabilities to make creative connections. They are driven by curiosity to learn from other experts both within the team and elsewhere in the organisation.
