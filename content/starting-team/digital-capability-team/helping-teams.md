Teams usually have people with different levels of experience in their discipline. They should all have some experience working as a multidisciplinary team and be open to collaborating.

You should encourage the people with more experience to mentor the people who are new to this way of working. This is a good way to help people who haven’t had the chance to increase the skills in their discipline because they cannot progress beyond a certain career point in a government role.

Give people who have skills and expertise in a particular area the chance work in a multidisciplinary team and often they will flourish.

There may be other people in your organisation who may not be as experienced but who are keen to learn and collaborate. Be open to pairing people who have less experience with experienced people from in and outside of government.

Sometimes it’s possible to use secondments to temporarily transfer people who are keen to collaborate from other parts of government to fill gaps in the team.
