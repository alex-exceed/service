Teams usually have people with different levels of experience in their role. They should all have some experience working as a multidisciplinary team and be open to collaborating.

You should encourage people with more experience to mentor those who are new to this way of working. This is a good way to help people who haven't had the chance to increase their skills because they can't progress beyond a certain career point in a government role.

Give people with skills and expertise in their role the chance to work in a multidisciplinary team and they will often flourish.

There may be other people in your organisation who are not as experienced but who are keen to learn and collaborate. Be open to pairing people who have less experience with experienced people from inside and outside of government.

Sometimes itâ€™s possible to use secondments to temporarily transfer people who are keen to collaborate from other parts of government to fill gaps in the team.
