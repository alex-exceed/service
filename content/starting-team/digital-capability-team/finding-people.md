If you are responsible for [setting up a team](../roles/) you can use recruitment exercises to assess how well people have worked in teams in the past.

You should find out how well the person will work both in their role and the team. Make sure your recruitment exercises explore people’s previous experience in:

-  focusing on meeting user needs
-  collaborating closely with people from other disciplines
-  being open to working in a new way

If you don’t have the chance to recruit from outside your organisation you can adapt the same recruitment exercises to find how people in your organisation have worked in previous teams.

Make sure the people you have in your team are practitioners with specific experience, rather than generalists.
