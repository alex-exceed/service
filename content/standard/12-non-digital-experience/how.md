During [Discovery stage](/service-design-delivery-process/discovery-stage/) and [Alpha stage](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/) you should have developed a good understanding of where users will go for the service you are building. You should understand what proportion of users rely on non-digital channels, wholly or in part, and have a plan for how you will address this in your build.

During Alpha you should show you understand:

- all the touchpoints in usersâ€™ journeys, their contexts of use, and the digital limitations affecting different groups of users
- existing channels and how they interact with the service and with each other
- the channels required to support all groups of users of the service, and where a user may need to change channels
- if there are any repeat transactions by users over different channels
- the interactions occurring between the channels that deliver and capture user transactions

During the [Beta stage](/service-design-delivery-process/beta-stage/) you will apply the knowledge gained in Alpha to design a service that works with the other channels, as appropriate.

By the end of Beta and [going live](/service-design-delivery-process/live-stage/), you should:

- detail the channels required to support all groups of users of the service
- understand the non-digital service channels and have a [plan to move users to the digital channel](/standard/13-encourage-use-of-the-digital-service) where appropriate
- have developed and tested the service so that a user can change channels without repeating themselves
