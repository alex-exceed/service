The moratorium applies to investments in service delivery capability made by Australian Government non-corporate Commonwealth entities under *[section 11(b) of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00414/Html/Text#_Toc450312934)*.

The moratorium does not apply to services owned by state, territory or local governments.

Information and transactional services [within the scope of the Digital Service Standard](/standard/scope-of-standard/) (the Standard) are covered by the moratorium. However, if you can demonstrate that you are working to meet, or have met, the Standard you will receive an [automatic exemption](#automatic-exemption).

Unless you have an exemption, you **cannot** make new investments in:

 - information services, such as new websites
 - transactional services
 - digital platforms, such as digital identity, voice authentication, and tell us once functionality
 - face-to-face service delivery capabilities, such as establishing new shopfronts
 - telephony service delivery capabilities, such as establishing new service centres and new telephony contracts
 - grant management ICT systems and administration capabilities, including outsourcing grant management processes and enhancing existing grant management processes.

You **can** invest in:

 - maintaining existing digital services, such as minor upgrades and maintenance
 - shopfront renewals and consolidations
 - extensions of existing contracts to telephony services.
