Your user research will give you a good understanding of where people want to access your service and their levels of digital skill. Through the [Discovery]() and [Alpha]() stages you need to understand:

- the users’ journeys and how they interact with your service, digitally or otherwise
- existing alternative channels and how users currently interact with them
- what percentage of users access digital and non-digital channels
- how you will increase digital take-up and what targets you will set.

As you continue developing your service and start testing it with users in Beta, you should:

- be increasing digital take-up; revising your targets and considering relevant performance metrics
- have a plan of how to move users to the digital channel where possible, including a communications plan to promote the service
- have agreed analytics/metrics for the volume of usage across channels
- understand the full impact of retiring any potentially redundant services and channels.

As you progress your service to Live you will need to show:

- how you’ve revised the targets you made in the Beta stage to increase the number of users (including users we need to assist) of your digital service
- what you’ve learned from testing different approaches to encourage users (including users we need to assist) to choose the digital service over non-digital alternatives, and which ones you’ll use in the Live stage
- your retirement strategy for any redundant services and channels
- that your service load capacity is scalable to meet increased digital take-up
- how you will promote your service and encourage people to use it, including how your messaging will appear in places where the users will see it.
