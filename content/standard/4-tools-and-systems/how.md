### [2]In Alpha stage

During the [Alpha stage](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/) you should be thinking about what you need to build the service. You should:

* review the types of tools and systems already available
* identify potential development tools and software to build the product
* identify the appropriate languages, frameworks, and other technical choices that are required to build the service
* understand who will own the intellectual property
* understand any data requirements of the service
* understand the development tool chain required for Beta
* understand the existing IT systems, data stores and in-flight processes for the service
* understand any potential external dependencies or integrations that would be required to build the product
* know the initial and ongoing costs for proposed tools and systems

### [2]In Beta stage

During the [Beta stage](/service-design-delivery-process/beta-stage/) you will be building the service and testing prototypes with users. You should:

* manage any constraints that the chosen development tools and software have placed on the service
* have a strong rationale for the technology choices youâ€™ve made, including the languages, frameworks and development tools
* procure the appropriate tools, systems and contractual arrangements and make sure you are getting value for money
* have the ability to conduct technical health checks of the service
* arrange for appropriate ongoing technical support and service level agreements for underlying or dependent services

By the time you [go live](/service-design-delivery-process/live-stage/) you should have in place:

* procedures for ongoing operations, including iterations, maintenance, monitoring, patching and upgrading system components
* funding to cover the long-term life of the product, including activities such as security accreditation
* evidence or artefacts that demonstrate you achieved the objective of the criteria for the Live stage
