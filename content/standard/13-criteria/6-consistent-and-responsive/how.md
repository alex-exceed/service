During [Alpha stage](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/) you need to consider the [design methods and patterns](https://guides.service.gov.au) you could apply in your service, and how you can communicate simply and clearly with your users. You should show that you:

- understand how you will use responsive design for platform independence
- understand how you will use existing design patterns and a front-end toolkit to make the service consistent
- create simpler and clearer information by understanding the language of your users, using [plain language by default](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#plain-english), and applying contemporary online writing methods
- follow accessibility better practice and are planning how your public prototype will meet [WCAG 2.0 level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag)
- ensure appropriate design, content design and front-end developer support is provided to the team

As you develop through [Beta stage](/service-design-delivery-process/beta-stage/) and progress to [Live stage](/service-design-delivery-process/live-stage/), you should be applying these principles and design methods and will be expected to show them in your service.
