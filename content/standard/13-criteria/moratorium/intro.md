The Australian Government has established a moratorium that stops Commonwealth (federal) agencies from investing in new, or duplicating, service delivery capability. The moratorium is an important tool to help government limit the fragmenting of usersâ€™ experience across the Australian Government.

If you are the project owner for a service delivery product, it is your responsibility to assess whether the moratorium applies to your proposed investment. You can talk to your Digital Transformation Coordinator or the Digital Transformation Agency ([moratorium@digital.gov.au](mailto:moratorium@digital.gov.au)) for help with this.
