During Alpha you need to consider the [design methods and patterns](https://guides.service.gov.au) you could apply in your service, and how you can communicate simply and clearly with your users. You should show that you:

- understand how you will use responsive design for platform independence
- understand how you will use existing design patterns and a front-end toolkit to make the service consistent
- create simpler and clearer information by understanding the language of your users, using plain language by default, and applying contemporary online writing methods
- follow accessibility better practice and are planning how your public prototype will meet [WCAG 2.0 level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag)
- ensure appropriate design, content design and front-end developer support is provided to the team.

As you develop through Beta and progress to Live, you should be applying these principles and design methods and will be expected to show them in your service.
