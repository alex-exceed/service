Good government services are built quickly and iteratively, based on user needs. Your [digital delivery team](/starting-team/) must be set up in the right way to do this.

They need:
- a broad mix of skills and roles from the start
- quick decision-making processes and the ability to change and adapt as the service evolves
- to be adequately resourced and empowered to deliver the product or service
