Good government services are built quickly and iteratively, based on user needs. Your [digital delivery team](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/design-guides/the-team/) must be set up in the right way to do this. They need:

- a broad mix of skills and roles from the start
- quick decision-making processes and the ability to change and adapt as the service evolves
- to be adequately resourced and empowered to deliver the product or service.
