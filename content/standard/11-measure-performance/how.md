You’ll have started early measurement activity during [Discovery]() with your user research dashboard.

You will need to consider how you’ll measure your service in more detail as you enter Alpha. By the end of Alpha you should have:

- explored the data that is already available for an existing service, where it is kept and how you might access and use it, and also shared your own insights
- collected baseline data for the service operation in all of its channels
- estimated the number of people you expect to use the service
- started creating a performance framework outlining your objectives and what metrics your team will use to demonstrate you meet them
- considered the metrics you will need to [measure the 4 KPIs](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/measuring-performance/) and where the data will come from.

By the end of Beta you will be able to show:

- which metrics and measurements you will use to monitor your KPIs
- the baseline measures and the benchmarks for success
- that the team is ready to report their performance on the [Performance Dashboard](https://www.dta.gov.au/what-we-do/platforms/performance/)
- which tools you use for analysis and web analytics in Beta (and Alpha if appropriate)
- what you have learned from qualitative and quantitative data; for example key evidence.

During the public Beta stage you’ll have been able to test your methods for data collection, validated that the data is accurate, and published service performance data on the Performance Dashboard.

As you go live you should be able to show service data on the Performance Dashboard and improvement to the service based on performance data.

Your data should show:

- user satisfaction has increased
- digital take-up is increasing in line with service plans
- completion rate has been maintained
- cost per transaction is decreasing in line with service plans.
