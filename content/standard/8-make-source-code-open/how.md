Final code will not be produced in Alpha, however you should still be thinking about how you can share what you create. During the Alpha stage, you’ll need to:

- show that you have considered a plan to release it under a [licence](https://choosealicense.com) that is suitable for your service
- consider publishing the source code on a platform with wide adoption in the open source community, such as [GitHub](https://github.com).


During Beta you’ll have developed further working code and should be ready to share your code in a repository. By the time you go live you should be able to show:

- how you are making new source code open and reusable, for example, storing in repositories, releasing code under licence, using APIs
- you have provided a plan or guidance for contributors
- how you’re handling updates and bug fixes to the code.
