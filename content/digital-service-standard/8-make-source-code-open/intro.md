## [3]Why it's in the Standard

It’s important to share your source code so others with a similar need can reuse it.

Open source helps to:

- reduce costs for your project and others’
- avoid lock-in
- stop duplication
- increase transparency
- add benefits, from improvements by other developers

## [3]How you can meet the Standard

Final code will not be produced in [Alpha stage](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/), however you should still be thinking about how you can share what you create. During the Alpha stage, you’ll need to:

- show that you have considered a plan to [release it under a licence](https://choosealicense.com) that is suitable for your service
- consider publishing the source code on a platform with wide adoption in the open source community, such as [GitHub](https://github.com).

During [Beta stage](/service-design-delivery-process/beta-stage/) you’ll have developed further working code and should be ready to share your code in a repository. By the time you [go live](/service-design-delivery-process/live-stage/) you should be able to show:

- how you are making new source code open and reusable, for example, storing in repositories, releasing code under licence, using APIs
- you have provided a plan or guidance for contributors
- how you’re handling updates and bug fixes to the code
