During [Alpha stage](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage/) you should understand what open standards and common platforms can be used for your service. You should:

- build using the open standards of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop prototypes
- follow government better practice and standards in the design of the service
- identify tools, systems, processes that can be adopted or reused from other services
- search for similar solutions in other jurisdictions

During [Beta stage](/service-design-delivery-process/beta-stage/) and as you [go live](/service-design-delivery-process/live-stage/) you should continue applying government solutions while also:

- building using the [Open Web Platform](https://www.w3.org/standards/) standards
- avoiding lock-in to any proprietary solutions where an open standard is available
- addressing any common user needs in a way that is consistent with the rest of government
