## [3]Why it's in the Standard

The technology you choose to build your service must help you respond quickly and regularly to the needs and expectations of users. This criteria makes sure you:

* consider all the risks and constraints associated with the technology you choose
* avoid contracts that lock you into particular solutions and limit your ability to make decisions to improve the service
* build a sustainable system that can be easily managed once live
* identify the required infrastructure to successfully and continuously deliver the digital service
* have a procurement approach that will not restrict, inhibit or limit ongoing and future service delivery
* consider existing tools and systems and avoid unnecessary fragmentation and/or costs
* consider appropriate tools and systems already in use in government
* embed measurement tools at the start of development
