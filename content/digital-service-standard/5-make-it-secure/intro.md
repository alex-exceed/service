## [3]Why it's in the Standard

People who use government services must have confidence that:

- any information they provide is confidential and stored appropriately
- the system theyâ€™re using is safe and secure
- they know how their information will be used by government
- they can easily retrieve information they provide

If a service cannot guarantee confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system, people will not use it
