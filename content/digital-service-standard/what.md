## [3]What is the Digital Service Standard?

The Digital Service Standard helps support digital teams build government services that
are simple, clear and fast.

It is not a checklist, but rather a set of best practice principles for how digital teams should work.

All government services which were designed or redesigned after 6 May 2016 fall within the [scope of the Standard](/digital-service-standard/scope-standard/) and must be assessed against it.

There is also a [moratorium on service investment](/digital-service-standard/moratorium/) that may apply to the service that you are working on.
