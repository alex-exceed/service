The Standard does not apply to state, territory or local government services. However, these jurisdictions may decide to apply the Standard to improve their service delivery.

Personal ministerial websites (that contain material on a minister’s party political activities or views on issues not related to their ministerial role) are not included in the scope of the Standard.

Full or partial exemptions from the Standard may be appropriate in certain cases — contact us for advice: [standard@digital.gov.au](mailto:standard@digital.gov.au?subject=Scope%20of%20the%20Standard)
