## [2]Services built or redesigned after 6 May 2016

Services will go through an independent assessment process that is either:

* a Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) led assessment â€“ for all new and redesigned transactional services that have / will have greater than 50,000 transactions per year (high volume)
* an agency self-assessment
    * for all new and redesigned transactional services that have / will have less than 50,000 transactions per year
    * any information service.

## [2]Existing services

For high volume transactional services that were operating or started redesign before 6 May 2016 you can check how well your service is performing against the Standard by inviting the DTA to do a review by emailing <standard@digital.gov.au>.

The DTA reviews of existing services will be similar to the [staged assessment process](). The DTA will arrange a team of experts to review your service against the Standard and give you recommendations on how you can make your service simpler, clearer and faster.
