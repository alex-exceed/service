All services that fall under the [scope of the Standard](/digital-service-standard/scope-standard/) must be assessed by a team of assessors.

Assessors help services to [meet the Standard](/digital-service-standard/meeting-standard/) and provide assurance that the criteria have been met.

To become an assessor, you will need to:

1. Be currently working in product management, delivery or agile, technical development, user research, service design or a related digital role

2. Be nominated by the team responsible for digital transformation in your agency, usually a digital transformation coordinator or team

3. Attend an [Assessing against the Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/training/) course

After completing training you will arrange with your agency to:

1. Shadow an assessment

2. Assess a service as part of an assessment team

3. Contribute to the assessment report that is [published on the DTA’s website](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/assessments/).

After your first assessment report is published, you will be recognised as an accredited assessor.

For further information please contact your agency’s Digital Transformation Coordinator or Digital Service Standard team.
