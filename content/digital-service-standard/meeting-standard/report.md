At each of the 3 stages - Alpha, Beta, Live - the assessment team produces a report. We publish [assessment reports](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/assessments/) on the DTA website to:

* contribute to a government-wide repository of better practice
* provide a resource for other teams redesigning or building services
* provide an easy way to share ideas within and across departments
* help agency teams to promote their good work
* provide an audit trail of progress to support the assessment process
* demonstrate commitment to the Standard and increasing transparency of government to the community.
