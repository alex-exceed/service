There are 2 possible outcomes from an assessment: pass or not pass.

Passing an assessment means the service team can continue to progress through the stages of the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/). For example, when a service passes a Beta assessment, the service can go public with Beta branding applied. When the service passes a Live assessment the Beta branding will be removed.

If a service does not pass an assessment the service should not progress beyond its current stage of development. To assist service teams, the assessment panelâ€™s report will provide recommendations on the actions the service manager might undertake to ensure the service will meet the Standard.

Depending on the stage of development, the service manager should arrange a re-assessment. The re-assessment is only required for those criteria that were not passed.

If the service does not pass an assessment twice the DTC is encouraged to seek assistance from the DTA.
