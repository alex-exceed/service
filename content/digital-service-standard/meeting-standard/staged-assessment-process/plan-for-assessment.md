It’s essential to embed the Standard in the way you work from the beginning. It will help you to build a better service from the start. Tools are available to help you track how your service meets the Standard in a progressive way.

The DTA recommends that you share your progress against the Standard as part of your weekly showcase. Then when it comes time for an assessment you’ll have a good basis of artefacts and activities from which to draw upon to show how you meet the Standard.

In preparing for an assessment, the service manager needs to be confident that they can show how the service meets the Standard. The service manager should be able to satisfactorily answer the questions asked by the assessment panel.

If a service does not pass an assessment the service manager should seek a re-assessment. The service will be assessed against the criteria that were not passed. When the service is undergoing a re-assessment, the assessment panel will work through all previous recommendations. The service manager should ensure that all recommendations have been addressed before scheduling a re-assessment.

Before you arrange an assessment, it’s recommended that the team runs a mock assessment to identify any potential issues.
