When the service manager is satisfied they can demonstrate the service meets the Standard, they should contact their Digital Transformation Coordinator (DTC) to arrange an assessment panel and schedule an assessment date. The assessment panel should be independent of the digital delivery team.

The service manager will need to provide the DTC with a pre-assessment brief. The brief should include:

* description of the service, including
    * the assessment stage - Alpha, Beta or Live
    * who the users of the service are
    * what user needs the service aims to meet
    * the scope of the service for the assessment stage
    * whether this service is intending to replace existing services or complement them
* a link to the service or prototype, including any information needed to access it; such as login details and dummy account data
* a high-level technical architecture diagram of the service, if appropriate.

The DTC should inform the DTA Standard team, by emailing <standard@digital.gov.au>, of the planned assessment. The DTA will track all assessments and ensure the self-assessment team has the support it needs to conduct the assessment and report its outcome.
