An assessment will consist of a discussion between the panel, the service manager and their team. The discussion is expected to take up to 4 hours.

The questions will be directed to the service manager, but the service manager can defer to other team members. Often these will include a technical architect, a designer, a user researcher or a delivery manager, but that’s up to you. The discussion should focus on what *has* been done, not what *will* be done.

Assessment conversations will generally follow a structure:

* Overview (5–15 minutes) – the service manager will explain
    * what the service is
    * reasons why it is being developed
    * who the users are
    * how it will meet their needs.
* Demonstration (20–45 minutes) – the service manager will demonstrate the service as close as possible to what will be made live, as appropriate to the stage. The assessors will ask questions during the demonstration.
* Review (up to 3 hours) – the assessors will go through the Standard focusing on how the service has met each criterion.
