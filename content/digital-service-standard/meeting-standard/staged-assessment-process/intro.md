All services within the [scope of the Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/scope-standard/) (the Standard) will be assessed against the Standard. Depending on the service, this will follow either the staged assessment process or the [in-flight assessment process]().

The staged assessment process uses 3 assessments against the [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/) across the stages of the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/).

1. **Alpha assessment** takes place at the end of the Alpha stage. The service must pass criteria 1 to 3 of the Standard and show progress against other criteria to progress to the Beta stage.

2. **Beta assessment** takes place during the Beta stage. The service must pass all criteria of the Standard before it can be released as a public beta.

3. **Live assessment** takes place at the end of the Beta stage. The service must meet all criteria of the Standard before it can be released as a live service.

Each assessment is a conversation between the [digital delivery team](/starting-team/roles/) and a panel of assessors who are experts in their field. The team provides a brief overview of the service including a live demonstration. The assessors will then ask the team questions about how the service meets the Standard.

Assessments take from 2 to 4 hours, depending on the complexity of the service and the stage of development.
