The service manager and the DTC will receive the outcome of the assessment (pass or not pass) and a report summarising the assessment within a few working days. The report will include recommendations with concise feedback on the service. The DTC will provide a copy of the report to the DTA to publish in the [assessment reports](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/assessments/) section of the DTA site.
