Your service will be assessed as it moves through the stages of the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/). Depending on the kind of service this can happen as:

* [in-flight assessment](#in-flight-assessment-process) - regular check-ins by a team of experts as you design and develop your service  
* [staged assessment]() - assessments at 3 points in the service design and delivery process.

DTA-led assessments on high volume transactional services will use the model most appropriate for the service and available resources.

For agency self-assessments on all other services, you may choose to use the [in-flight process]() or the [staged assessment process](standard/inflight-check-in-spreadsheet).

To help you see what to expect from your assessment, you can read our:
