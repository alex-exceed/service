Launching your service is only the beginning. Once a service goes live you will need to keep listening to your users to make sure it continues to meet their needs and you are still following the Standard.

You will need to continue to update and improve the service on the basis of user feedback, performance data, changes to best practice and service demand.

You will also need to check:

* high levels of user satisfaction and transaction completion are maintained
* cost per transaction is decreasing
* digital take-up is increasing, and assisted digital support is provided to the people who really need it
* progress against other service-specific measurements you identified during the service development.
