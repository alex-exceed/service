In-flight and staged assessments are conducted by a team that is independent of the [digital delivery team](/starting-team/roles/). The assessors are experts and practitioners in their field, and will usually be working on their own projects. This ensures that the knowledge and skills of the assessors are up to date.

The assessing team will generally include 3 assessors (one of which is nominated as the lead assessor) who represent:

* service design/user research
* technology
* agile delivery.

You can contact the DTA Standard team by emailing <standard@digital.gov.au> for help on setting up an assessment team.
