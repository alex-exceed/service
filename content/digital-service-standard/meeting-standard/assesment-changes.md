As your service moves through the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/) the assessments become more comprehensive:

1. By the end of **Alpha stage** the service must have passed criteria 1 to 3 of the Standard and show progress against other criteria.
2. During the **Beta stage** the service must have passed all criteria of the Standard before you can release the product as a public beta.
3. At the end of the Beta stage, before you move to the **Live stage** you must have passed all criteria of the Standard.

If your service doesn’t meet the Standard it shouldn’t progress through the service design and delivery process until the relevant criteria of the Standard have been met.
