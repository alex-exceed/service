## [3]Why it's in the Standard

Using [open standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard) and common government platforms helps you to:

- meet the needs of your users by building with proven solutions
- make usersâ€™ experience of government more consistent, which generates trust
- save time and money by reusing things that are already available
- be more efficient by sharing data appropriately
- move between different technologies when you need to, avoiding vendor lock-in
