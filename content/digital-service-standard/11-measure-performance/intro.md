## [3]Why it's in the Standard

Every service must aim for continuous improvement. Metrics are an important starting point for discussions about a service’s strengths and weaknesses. By identifying and capturing the right metrics — with the right tools — you can make sure all your decisions to improve the service are supported by data.

### [3]Key performance indicators

All services must, at a minimum, measure 4 KPIs:

- **user satisfaction** — to help continually improve the user experience of your service
- **digital take-up** — to show how many people are using the service and to help encourage users to choose the digital service
- **completion rate** — to show which parts of the service you need to fix
- **cost per transaction** — to make your service more cost efficient

There will be other metrics your service needs to measure and monitor to understand how it is performing, such as:

- error rates
- time to completion
- costs, benefits and return on investment
- content metrics (readability, length)

### [2]Dashboard

The [Performance Dashboard](https://www.dta.gov.au/what-we-do/platforms/performance/) collects service data and presents it in a consistent and structured format. This is important so that you can:

- make quick data-driven decisions about how to improve your service
- compare data across multiple government services
- be open and transparent to the public about your service’s performance
