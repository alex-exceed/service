You should know the [roles you need to run your service](/starting-team/roles/), based on your experience of building it.

As you iterate and improve different parts of your service, you may find the team size changes along with your need for specialist roles.

Don't disband your service team after you go live. You need a multidisciplinary team to continuously improve the service and respond to additional and changing needs from the service over time.

If the service is handed over to a different team you will lose the empathy and experience developed through the previous stages. Also a ‘business as usual’ team will not keep iterating and improving it.
