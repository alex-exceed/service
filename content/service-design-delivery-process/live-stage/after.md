After you move to the Live stage you should keep improving your service based on user feedback, analytics and further user research.

If the team needs to work with other teams to support the live service make sure that you are using the same artefacts. Everyone should be working using the same user stories.

You should also:
- continue doing user research
- monitor the status of your service
- maintain uptime and availability
- practise vulnerability and penetration testing
- test your serviceâ€™s performance
- maintain quality assurance

You should repeat the service design and delivery stages (Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live) for smaller pieces of work as your service continues running. This means you:
- keep finding things that need improvement
- do research to get the best solutions
- iterate and then release
