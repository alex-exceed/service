After the service goes live you need to keep measuring and reporting on the [Performance Dashboard](https://dashboard.gov.au/). This includes [4 key performance indicators for government services](/digital-service-standard/11-measure-performance/):
- user satisfaction
- digital take-up
- completion rate
- cost per transaction

Use your findings to help you understand how to improve your service. Keep testing that your metrics are telling you what you need to know.
