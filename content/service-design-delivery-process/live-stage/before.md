Before you can make your service live, you must make sure:
- the user can complete the full end-to-end journey
- the service meets the user needs you found in your Discovery, Alpha and Beta stages
- you are securing the service’s information
- you have proven that your public beta service is functionally complete and performs better than any existing services
- you can continue to accurately measure and report the success of your service on the [Performance Dashboard](https://dashboard.gov.au/)
- you have a plan for the transition or integration of any existing services that meet a similar user needs to yours
- the service fully meets the [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/) and can continue to do so
- you can support the service and you’ll be able to keep iterating it and improving it until it’s retired

In many cases, a live service will be the first step on a wider transformation roadmap, so the code, design, infrastructure and learnings from the service delivery can be re-used.
