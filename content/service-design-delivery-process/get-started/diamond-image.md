The first 3 stages of the service design and delivery process are similar to the double diamond phases of discover, define, develop and deliver:

- In the first half of the Discovery stage you go wide with user research to understand the problem (discover phase).
- In the second half of the Discovery stage you narrow in on the biggest pain points to really understand them so you can define hypotheses (define phase).
- In Alpha stage you test your hypotheses using prototypes until you can define a minimum viable product (develop phase).
- In Beta stage you build the minimum viable product (deliver phase).
