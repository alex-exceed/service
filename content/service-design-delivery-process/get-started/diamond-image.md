imageAlt: "The double diamond design process. Start narrow with Discovery and go wide as you discover and gather data. Then narrow in to get to define the problem and narrow the scope. Start to go wide at the beginning of alpha as you explore possibilities and develop your prototypes. When you are confident you have something like the solution and then go narrow again define the constraints and deliver."

The first 3 stages of the service design and delivery process are similar to the double diamond process of discover, define, develop and deliver:

- In the first half of Discovery stage you are going wide with user research to understand the problem (discover — the first half of the first diamond).
- In the second half of Discovery you narrow in on the biggest pain points to really understand them so you can define hypotheses (Define — the second half of the first diamond).
- In Alpha stage you test your hypotheses using prototypes until you can define a minimum viable product (Develop — the first half of the second diamond).
- In Beta stage you build the minimum viable product (Deliver — the second half of the second diamond).
