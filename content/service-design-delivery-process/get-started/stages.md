The service design and delivery process is an agile approach with 4 stages:
- [Discovery stage](/service-design-delivery-process/discovery-stage/) — the team gets a deep understanding of the users and their needs, and developing hypotheses to solve the problems
- [Alpha stage](/service-design-delivery-process/alpha-stage) — the team builds prototypes to test the hypotheses
- [Beta stage](/service-design-delivery-process/beta-stage) — the team builds and tests a solution based on the hypotheses validated in Alpha
- [Live stage](/service-design-delivery-process/live-stage) — the team is changed to maintain and improve the service

The stages build on each other but they don’t always go in order. Sometimes a service might go back to an earlier stage (for example, if a service in Beta needs to go back to Discovery to work on a different problem).
