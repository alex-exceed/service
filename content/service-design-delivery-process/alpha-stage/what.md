At the start of Alpha stage, you should have a good understanding of the user journey and the major stages.

The team will keep improving the user journey map as the team’s understanding of the journey grows.
You should work in an agile way, iterating regularly so that you can learn quickly.

When the team has some certainty about the journey of users, create a user story map. This will help you define the minimum viable product (MVP).

In Alpha stage, you:
- take your hypotheses from Discovery stage and create some high-level concepts
- continue to develop a vision for the service using your user journey and user story map
- create storyboards to see possible solutions
- create a [range of prototypes]() to test hypotheses with users — you should explore these with different kinds, including paper and HTML
- complete the stage by defining the minimum viable product
