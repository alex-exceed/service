quote: Keep the same team in Alpha stage.

The same team that worked in the Discovery stage should continue to work in Alpha stage. This keeps the existing empathy, context and momentum.

You may need to add some other roles and capability in Alpha stage:
- business analyst
- technical architect
- agile coach
