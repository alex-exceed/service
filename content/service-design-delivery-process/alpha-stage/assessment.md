There are different [ways your service will be assessed](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/meeting-standard/) against the Digital Service Standard.

In most cases, you’ll go through an assessment based on what you need to do in the Alpha stage before you can move to Beta.

### [2]Deciding not to move on to Beta

You may decide to end your service work in Alpha rather than continue into Beta.

For example, you may find that:
- user needs for the service are already being met by another government service or the private sector
- it costs too much to build the service based on the number of people who will use it
- there’s a better non-digital solution
- adapting or developing another service is a better solution

It’s still a successful Alpha stage if you decide not to move on to Beta because it means you have learned more about the problem and you won’t waste time and money.

### [2]Deciding to start a new Alpha

At the end of Alpha you may decide to start a new Alpha or even Discovery because you work out you need to focus on different things. For example, you might identify a completely different user need that you want to explore through further research.
