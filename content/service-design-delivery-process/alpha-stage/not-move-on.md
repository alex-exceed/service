You may decide to end your service work in Alpha stage rather than continue into Beta stage.

For example, you may find that:
- user needs for the service are already being met by another government service or the private sector
- it costs too much to build the service based on the number of people who will use it
- there’s a better non-digital solution
- adapting or developing another service is a better solution

It’s still a successful Alpha stage if you decide not to move on to Beta because it means you have learned more about the problem and you won’t waste time and money.
