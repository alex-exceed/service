The [decision register](../discovery-stage/#document-your-process) that you set up in Discovery becomes even more important in Alpha. It contains the evidence that guides what you will build, including:
- an explanation of the problem
- empathy map
- insight map
- results of affinity mapping
- pain points
- hypotheses
- concepts for solutions
- decisions about changes in direction or why work on some solutions was stopped
- user feedback and actions taken

The register allows you to trace why you decided on a particular solution.
