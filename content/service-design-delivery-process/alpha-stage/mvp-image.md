By the end of Alpha, you will have a developed the user story map in depth.

The team should agree on a line across the user story map. What is above the line should reflect what is most important for the user and what the team can achieve. This will be your minimum viable product (MVP). This is the simplest thing you can build that meets the user need.

The MVP will set out the scope of what is built in Beta stage. The research you have been doing since Discovery stage will help you make choices about the technology you will use to build it.
