The [user journey map](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/21/how-to-make-a-user-journey-map/) is the most important artefact you will start in Discovery.

The user journey map shows all of the steps that a user goes through to get what they need done, including their interactions with different parts of government and other organisations. For example, to lodge your tax return you need to:
- get your documents together
- declare what you have earned
- work out what you can claim
- send information to the government

The user journey map needs to show the journeys of real users that youâ€™ve met, not an ideal user journey. It is not a map of existing business processes.
