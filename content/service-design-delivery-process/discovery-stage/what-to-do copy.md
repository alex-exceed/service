The purpose of Discovery is to do user research to understand the problem you need to solve. You will examine:
- all the channels and touchpoints of the service (not just digital)
- the end-to-end user experience
- key user groups

The team will need to understand the whole user experience and look at other related products and services delivered in their organisation.

To complete a service a user may have to interact with products and websites run by other teams. The user may also have to deal with other parts of government or commercial organisations.

The team should look at existing research done by other teams, but it is essential the team does its own research with users through all stages of the process.
