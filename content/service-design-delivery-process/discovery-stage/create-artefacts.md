You will create several artefacts and keep adding to them as you go through Discovery. The team will keep building and validating these artefacts — especially the user journey map — as you go through the later stages. 

An [empathy wall](/user-research/research-stages/#user-research-in-discovery-stage) helps the team understand how real users get things done and their experience with current service and products.

An [insight wall](/user-research/analysing-user-research/#share-your-findings) shows people’s pain points with quotes that reflect their problems with current products and services, and what they are trying to do.
