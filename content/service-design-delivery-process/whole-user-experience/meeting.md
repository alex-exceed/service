You need a service manager to own the service and a team to build and maintain it to meet these criteria:

- [Criteria 1: Understand user needs](/digital-service-standard/1-understand-user-needs/)
- [Criteria 2: Have a multidisciplinary team](/digital-service-standard/2-multidisciplinary-team/)
- [Criteria 3: Agile and user-centred process](/digital-service-standard/3-agile-and-user-centred/)
- [Criteria 9: Make it accessible](/digital-service-standard/9-make-it-accessible/)
- [Criteria 10: Test the service](/digital-service-standard/10-test-the-service/)
- [Criteria 12: Donâ€™t forget the non-digital experience](/digital-service-standard/12-non-digital-experience/)

The [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/) guides teams to build services that are simpler, clearer and faster.
