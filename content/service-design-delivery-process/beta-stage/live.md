Your service is ready to move on to the Live stage when you’re sure:
- it delivers the full end-to-end user journey
- it meets and can continue to meet the Digital Service Standard and passes the Beta to Live assessment
- you can support it and you’ll be able to keep iterating and improving it until it’s retired

### [2]Your Beta stage to Live stage assessment

There are different [ways your service will be assessed](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/meeting-standard/) against the Digital Service Standard. In most cases, you’ll go through an assessment on the public beta service at the end of the Beta stage.

When you pass this assessment, you’ll be able to go to Live stage and replace the existing service.
