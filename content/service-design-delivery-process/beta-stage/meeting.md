You must follow the service design and delivery process to meet [Criteria 3: Agile and user-centred process](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/3-agile-and-user-centred/) of the Digital Service Standard.

You will have to explain how you are following the service design and delivery process in the 2 assessments during Beta stage:
- before you go from a [private beta to releasing a public beta service]()
- before you move [from the public beta to Live stage]()

The [Digital Service Standard](/standard/) guides teams to build services that are simpler, clearer and faster.
