At the end of the Beta stage you will have:
- launched a private beta service followed by a public end-to-end service
- made a prioritised list of work to be done (your backlog)
- made a plan for ongoing user research
- published your dashboard
- built a working system that can be used in full by users

Make sure you plan how you will meet the resourcing needs when the service scales up.

After the service goes live, the multidisciplinary team should stay in place to keep momentum and make sure the service continues to be iterated and improved.
