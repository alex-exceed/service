Once you have built the minimum viable product you will release it to test with real users, first as a private beta and then a public beta, alongside the current service.

### [2]Private beta

A private beta is a beta that isn’t open to everyone. Don’t launch your service publicly in private beta — make it invite-only.

A private beta allows you to:
- have more control over the type of user that gets to use the beta service
- restrict the volume of transactions that go through the beta service
- start small and get quick feedback before releasing the service out to a wider audience

### [2]Public beta

A public beta is a version of your service that’s available for any member of the public to use. It will exist at the same time as the current available service.

This version of the prototype is available to all users, who can choose to use it if they are willing to try something new.
