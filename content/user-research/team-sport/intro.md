subtitle: Everyone in the service team should be involved in watching and analysing research with real users.
category: User research

All team members should watch real users interacting with your service and talking about it, ideally for at least 2 hours every 6 weeks.

These ‘exposure hours’ can be interviews, home or workplace visits, lab-based usability tests or any other research activities where people can watch and listen to real users.

You may need to use videos of research sessions to help new team members get used to doing this. But it's always better that they observe users in person.
