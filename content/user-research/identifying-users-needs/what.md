A need is a result of a problem. User needs are things that people want to feel and have to do that bring them to your service.


Things that people want to feel reflect something that has happened in their life. For example, someone who has lost their job may feel anxious. They want to feel reassured that help is available.


Things that people have to do are the practical tasks that they need to complete. For example, the person who has lost their job may have to fill out a form to get financial support.

You meet usersâ€™ needs with all the things that let them find, access, use and exit your service.
