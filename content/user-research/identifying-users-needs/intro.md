When designing a government service, always start by learning about the people who use what is currently available and those who will be the future users of your service.

If you don’t understand who the users are or what they need from your service, you can’t build the right thing.

Your [user research plan](../planning-user-research/) should start with how you will find out who the users are and their needs.
