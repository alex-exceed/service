[Service Design in Australian Government](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.gov.au/forum/#!forum/service-design-in-australian-government) is a group for people who are doing design (all kinds!), user research, content design, web analytics, product management, accessibility — anything that is contributing to great service design for public services in Australia.

It is for all parts of government: federal, state and local. We're sharing our experiences here so that we can all help to deliver better public services for Australians.

Email [leisa.reichelt@digital.gov.au](mailto:leisa.reichelt@digital.gov.au), Head of Service Design, Content and Capability at the Digital Transformation Office.

You’ll need a government email address or otherwise, leave a note to explain how you’re working on government services.
