**[REVISIT]**

At the beginning of the project it is important for the team to frame the service around the needs and goals of your users. This is why the [Discovery stage](#) is important.



You will change the way you do user research as you move through Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live.

Once youâ€™ve built a prototype, you need to test it with users to make sure it works. To do this you do


The research techniques you use change depending on:
- where you are in the process
- maturity of the service (if it is operational)
- research questions you are trying to answer

Always do research with a broad range of users, including those with access needs and low digital skills.

Think about the whole service ecosystem and [whole user experience](#), not just the digital service you are delivering.
