Sometimes you may have to start work without having access to a full-time user researcher. You should make it a priority to get this resource as soon as you can.

There may be some things you may be able to do in the meantime, like [pop-up research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/doing-pop-up-research). But it’s always better to get help from an experienced user researcher.

GOV.UK has a useful blog on [getting started with user research](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/18/so-youre-going-to-be-a-user-researcher-top-tips-to-get-you-going/).

### [2]Don’t outsource user research

You and your team need to do user research so you properly understand what you need to build, and that you are building the right thing.

You need to do the user research yourself so you have a better understanding of the relationship between what was asked and what was found.

It is especially important in the Discovery stage that you and your team talk to real users so you can build empathy.

### [2]Get help from other agency research teams

Your agency may already have existing teams that you can engage with to support your user research. They may be able to help you recruit users for your research.

These teams are sometimes there to make sure the agency is meeting the needs of users with disability or who speak different languages.

Don’t rely on other agency teams to do the research. Everyone on your team needs to be engaging with users to know you’re building the right thing.
