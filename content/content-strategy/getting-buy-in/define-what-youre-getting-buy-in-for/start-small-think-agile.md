Don’t be afraid to start small. Smaller and more frequent iterations will help build credibility as you show growing improvement. This means less risk and more opportunity to make long term improvements to a product or service.

Adjust your scope if you are faced with resistance. Start small with a ‘pilot’ strategy to test improvements. You could also choose quick, visible improvements such as fixing broken links or making general readability or accessibility improvements.

Change can be managed effectively through an [agile and user-centred approach](/digital-service-standard/3-agile-and-user-centred/).
