Your pitch for content improvement should ideally be structured around the goal to meet a user need (and in turn a business need).  

Your pitch should be simple and can be presented in a short slide deck that includes:
- the opportunity for change
- the need for change. For example, quotes from user research, case studies and statistics that support your case
- the need to follow broader government guidelines, such as the [Digital Service Standard](/digital-service-standard/) and the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/)
- what you need from the decision makers. For example, time, money and people
- what the risks are
- what it will involve. For example, a roadmap of the activities, costs and key delivery milestones
- what comes next: tell them what the first thing is you need from them. For example, approval for a content audit, hiring more people or even getting buy-in from another agency
