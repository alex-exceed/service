subtitle: If you’re planning a major removal of content from your website, you’ll need to get a plan in place of the people, time and responsibilities.

Having a record of your plan is perfect for keeping all stakeholders aware of their roles throughout the process.

Follow the same template as [Identify your stakeholders](../identify-stakeholders/) but make sure you include these 5 things:

1. Agreement — mark who is responsible for approving each of the removed pages and document their agreement.
2. Roles — agree who is responsible for each removal step, this includes technical requirements, communication (both internal and external), archival, content management and risk management.
3. Retention — how long do you need to keep different types of content.
4. Implementation — the tasks to [responsibly remove content](../remove-content-from-web/).
5. Schedule — so that all actions happen at the same time.

In addition, you can negotiate standard removal periods for common types of content, such as media releases or industry notices. For example, you might only retain content for current year and previous 2 years, rather than build up a large backlog online.

Publish your timeframes to remove content internally. This will help you to initiate regular content reviews and to negotiate removal periods.
