Research similar websites across the Australian Government, state governments and any relevant industry sites. Looking at international government websites can also be useful.

Consider:
- What other Australian Government agencies or industry bodies are already filling content gaps with useful content?
- Are these pages you can link to instead of including in your own structure?

This early stage of your IA process is the best time to be innovative in your thinking.  Just because it was done one way in the last website doesnâ€™t mean it has to be done the same way in the future. You should test your ideas (link to content testing module) with users to check.

Your research may also help you if you have difficulty deciding or agreeing on specific labels for the IA. In these cases, external research or an objective opinion may be able to resolve these issues.
