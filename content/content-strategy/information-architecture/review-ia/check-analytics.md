Use analytics data to help you evaluate your content.

Information to particularly focus on are:
- most visited pages
- least visited pages
- search terms
- bounce rates and exit pages
- landing pages
- average session duration
- pages per session
- new sessions vs return visitors
- referring sites
- behaviour flow

Some ways that you might use analytics data to develop your IA are:
- Popular content will be some of the first items you might include your new website.  Look at popular pages and consider what they are doing right, and whether they are meeting user needs.  If there is a very popular page consider expanding it into a section or multiple pages on the website where appropriate.
- Consider removing, renaming or improving least popular pages.  Improvements may involve adding more useful content and/or a more findable location in the structure.
- Behaviour flow will show you how users are travelling through your site.  Use this information to identify popular content and patterns of behaviour.
- Search terms may help you to create headings for your IA.  This may also help with search engine optimisation (link to SEO module).
- Remember that each page on your website is a landing page.  A user may arrive there first, rather than the home page.  Are there popular landing pages that can tell you what users are looking for on your site?
- Bounce rates and exit pages may tell you about the exit behaviour of users.  Look at the pages they are on and when they leave and decide if these pages should be removed, renamed and/or improved on the new site. Remember that they may also be exiting the website at that point because they have completed their task.
