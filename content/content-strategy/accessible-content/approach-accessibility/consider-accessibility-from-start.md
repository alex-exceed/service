It is much easier to achieve accessibility when you factor it in from the start. Where possible, agencies need to allow time to write content to be accessible and to test it for conformance before publishing live.

Content creators should adopt the practice of writing for the web. With web pages, most content types get published within a content management system (CMS). Many CMSs will have inbuilt CSS styles that help content authors to conform with accessibility on a web page.

In any case, any additional format that you publish must be structured in a way that is accessible.
