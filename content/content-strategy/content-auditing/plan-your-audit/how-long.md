Your timeframe for a content audit will depend on the type of audit, as well as your budget and resources. Full audits across big digital estates can take 6 months or longer but sample audits on a smaller website can be done in a week. Generally, content auditing and analysis is time consuming. But it will save time in the long term as you will know what you have and how best to manage and improve your content.
