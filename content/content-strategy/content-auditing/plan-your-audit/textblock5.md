Now that you've gathered the evidence on why you need a content audit, your plan should outline:
- the purpose of the website
- the high-level goal of the audit
- the size and type of audit
- how you'll conduct the audit
- how much time it will take and how many people
- roles and responsibilities
- how you'll measure success and manage any risks along the way

Think of any questions that stakeholders might ask about your plan and prepare some answers.
