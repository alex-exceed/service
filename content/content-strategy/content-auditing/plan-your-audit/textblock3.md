To decide on the scope and type of content audit, you'll need to consider:
- the budget
- resources available for a defined timeframe
- the actions you want to take after the audit

### [1]3 types of content audit to choose from

- full: all content items on the website/s — pages and other items like downloadable files or videos
- partial: for example, the past 6 months of content, or content about a certain topic
- sample: collect representative examples of content from across the website

A sample audit is the best option if you are working on a website with large amounts of content and you have limited time and resources.

There is no magic number for sampling, but you should choose enough content to represent the broader picture of your website. It should include a balance of content types, user groups and ideally enough content to show emerging patterns. You could start by auditing pages with high-traffic, high-profile sections, or pages that haven’t been updated recently.
