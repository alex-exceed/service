You can reduce the scope of the audit and strategically choose areas for focus.

### [1] Content quick wins

A few quick wins will help you to build momentum and motivation. For example you might focus on:
- news items you published 4 years ago that you can retire easily
- broken links you can fix
- working with content owners and approvers that you have good relationships with who will give quick approval for content to be retired

### [1]Areas that will make the highest impact

To make high impact changes you might focus on auditing content that has:
- the highest number of views and poorest readability
- attracted more than a certain number of views (for example, all pages that had over 1000 views in the last 12 months)
- been published in the last year
