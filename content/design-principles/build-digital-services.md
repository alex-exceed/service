A service is something that helps people to do something. Our job is to uncover user needs and build the service that meets those needs. Of course much of that will be pages on the web, but weâ€™re not here to build websites. The digital world has to connect to the real world, so we have to think about all aspects of a service, and make sure they add up to something that meets user needs.
