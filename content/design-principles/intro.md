Use these principles to guide you to design and build services that meet the [Digital Service Standard](../standard/).

Like the [UK Government Digital Service Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles), we will be adding examples to show you how we have been using them.

- [Do less.](#do-less-)
- [Design with data.](#design-with-data-)
- [Do the hard work to make it simple.](#do-the-hard-work-to-make-it-simple-)
- [Iterate. Then iterate again.](#iterate-then-iterate-again-)
- [This is for everyone.](#this-is-for-everyone-)
- [Understand context.](#understand-context-)
