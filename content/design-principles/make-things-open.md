We should share what we’re doing whenever we can: with colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets — howlers are spotted, better alternatives are pointed out and the bar is raised.

Much of what we’re doing is only possible because of open source code and the generosity of the web design community. We should pay that back.
